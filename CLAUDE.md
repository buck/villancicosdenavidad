Fifteen years ago or so, I built a web site about Spanish
Christams carols, called Villancicos.  The web site stores its
mp3 files in Amazon S3, and had s bit of Javascript to play
the mp3s when clicked, while reading the lyrics of the songs.
The website went offline at some point and I did not save the
HTML of the site.  But the Archive.org Wayback machine has the
working site available here:

https://web.archive.org/web/20090323121325/http://mesaespanola.org/villancicos/VillancicosdeNavidad.html

I would like to recreate the site wit the mp3 files and HTML in
a github.io personal website.

I would like to update the mp3 player function to whatever is
modern.  I presume playing mp3s is built into web browsers and
HTML5 now.

Can you scrape the archive.org site and build a github repo
locally that I can publish as a github.9o site?
