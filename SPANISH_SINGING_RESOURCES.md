# Spanish Singing Resources & Group Song Ideas

## Matched Lyrics/Audio Repositories

### Academic/Research:
- **DALI Dataset** (Synchronized Audio Lyrics) - research project with time-aligned lyrics
- **LyricsAlign** - academic dataset for lyrics-audio alignment
- **Musixmatch** - commercial service with synced lyrics (powers Spotify's lyrics feature)
- **Genius** - has some synced lyrics but inconsistent

### Karaoke Sites:
- Karaoke databases (KaraFun, SingSnap) have matched audio/lyrics by definition
- But usually instrumental tracks, not original recordings

### Problem:
Most resources are English-heavy. Spanish resources are less common, and finding the *exact* recording match is still rare. This is what made the manual matching effort for this villancicos site so valuable.

## What Spanish Speakers Sing in Groups

### Rancheras & Mariachi (Mexico)
Very popular for group singing at celebrations:
- "Cielito Lindo"
- "La Bamba"
- "Guadalajara"
- "El Rey"

### Boleros (romantic, across Latin America)
- "Bésame Mucho"
- "Quizás, Quizás, Quizás"
- "Solamente Una Vez"

### Folk/Traditional (varies by country)
- "Guantanamera" (Cuba)
- "La Cucaracha" (Mexico)
- Regional folk songs

### Protest/Social Songs
- "Gracias a la Vida" (Violeta Parra)
- Nueva Canción movement songs

### Kids Songs/Rounds
- "Los Pollitos Dicen"
- "Arroz Con Leche"
- "Cucaracha Tap Tap"

### Spanish Covers of International Hits

## Next Steps for Spanish Practice Group

For a Spanish practice/learning group, **rancheras and boleros** would be the natural next genre after villancicos:
- They're singable and memorable
- Culturally important across Spanish-speaking communities
- Widely known and loved
- Good for language practice

The same challenge applies: finding matched recordings and lyrics that exactly correspond to each other.
